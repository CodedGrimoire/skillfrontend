# SkillBridge Frontend

SkillBridge is a tutoring marketplace UI that lets learners discover vetted tutors, browse categories, and manage bookings. The frontend is built with modern Next.js app routing and consumes a separate API service for data.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router) with React 19
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Axios for API requests
- ESLint + TypeScript configs for linting

## Run Locally
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
The dev server starts at `http://localhost:3000`.
